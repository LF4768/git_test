    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
        This is the start of my coding journey after failing in my life once already.<br>
        <strong> I will not let the setback be the end of it all </strong> and only <em>grow stronger from it.</em>
    </p>

    <p> I will learn all there is to it about web development and study something related to coding everyday
        without failure.</p>

    <!-- I Might never mentally recover from this setback-->

    <p class="intro">The classic Indian flatbread Kulcha is best enjoyed with a robust Punjabi Chana Masala.
        This combination was, is and will always remain a winner! So, in this post,
        I have got my Kulcha Bread for you to try at home.<br>
        It is a fact that Amritsar in Punjab houses the best kulchas in the world.
        But this Kulcha recipe of mine can also give a tough competition to them!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the all-purpose flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl.
                Make a well in the center. Add the yogurt, oil and water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Begin to mix the flour with the liquids first and then start to knead. Make a smooth, soft and supple
                dough.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>In the same bowl or pan, cover the dough with a wet kitchen napkin and let the dough rest for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Make small balls of the dough and flatten them a bit. Sprinkle some nigella seeds or sesame seeds on the
                dough ball.</li>
            <br>
            <li>With the rolling pin, flatten the dough and roll each into a small-sized kulcha.
                <br>Do not roll thin but have a medium thickness similar to a paratha or slightly thicker than paratha.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat a flat skillet or a tawa. Place the kulcha on the hot tawa.
                Cook one side partially till its 1/4th cooked. Flip and cook the other side till it is 1/2 cooked.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Apply oil or ghee on both sides of kulcha while roasting. You can skip the oil or ghee if you prefer.
                Flip a few times as needed and roast the kulcha till it gets golden spots and is evenly cooked. Prepare
                more
                kulchas in a similar way.</li>
            <br>
            <li>As you prepare them, stack the cooked kulcha in a roti-basket, so that they stay warm.
                Serve Kulcha hot with chana masala.</li>
